# ANDOR - 8 bit breadboard computer

This is my version of Ben Eater's 8-bit breadboard computer.

This is my 8-bit breadboard computer built primarily from Low-power Schottky (LS) integrated circuits. It is based on the SAP-1 in Albert Paul Malvinoâ€™s book, Digital Computer Electronics. This breadboard design implementation of the SAP-1 was expertly explained by Ben Eater in his YouTube video series.

Inspired by Ben Eater and his EXCELLENT youtube series about building an 8 bit breadboard computer, I have finished the computer, and am now "debugging" it and testing it.  It's fully operational, I just have not verified that it's "doing" what I expect!

I make lots of upgrades ....
